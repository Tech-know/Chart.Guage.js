Chart.Guage.js
==============

Geck-o-meter like Guage Extension for Chart.js [chartjs.org](http://www.chartjs.org)


This chart is not yet completely finished. It does work as is however it does not function 
the same way all Chart.js charts do. I wrote this for an internal project and I will continue
to update it until it makes full use of the Chart.js Libary.

Please keep Issue submission to a minimum as I know there are still some bugs.

PR's are welcome and I will do my best to look over them. 

#### To Do
- Change from Set Timeout Animation to rAF
- Allow for elements make use of Chart.js ._saved methods for static updates
- Add Different Styles of Guage / Needle
- Add Documentation and Comment Code
